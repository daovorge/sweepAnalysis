DESCRIPTION:
------------
This directory contains code to read text exports of sweep SSVEP data (generated by PowerDiva Host or Pro) and organize the data into Matlab variables for plotting, statistical analysis, model fitting, and other applications.


GETTING STARTED:
----------------
The script example.m contains an outline of how to analyze a PowerDiva Pro export. The example data is provided in exampleData/.


INFO ABOUT CONTENTS:
--------------------

subdirectories:
-functions (still in development)
-scriptsForDevelopment (temporary files to be deleted as functionality is developed)
-exampleData (a PowerDiva Pro export of a SSVEP experiment)

key functions:
-getSweepDataFlex.m (reads text file exports & returns selected data)
-makeDataStructure.m (loops over all conditions & selected channels, calling getSweepDataFlex.m and storing results in an array of structs)


NOTES ON DEVELOPMENT:
---------------------
This code is still very much in development. Several functions need to be cleaned up & combined & made more flexible and other functions need to be created.

-Wherever you see the string ### in a comment, I have noted something that I’d like to find easily so I can change or update it later on.

-Eventually, I’d like to change to an object oriented approach instead of using structs.

-We need to make bridge functions to the rcaDevelopment code so that the same plotting and parameter estimation routines can be applied to reliable components (rather than sensors).

-We need to implement the ability to plot arbitrary combinations of datasets in single plots, e.g. to compare different groups of subjects or to compare results across frequencies, across experiments with different stimulus levels, etc.

-We need to make the code flexible enough to handle all the different kinds of EEG datasets that PowerDiva can handle (e.g. low channel, TACS, starstim, 128 channel). This primarily affects getSweepDataFlex.m & any potential dependencies on how the output variables are formatted.
